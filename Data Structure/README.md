# Chapter 04 – Data Structures

This chapter explores Python's built-in data structures and their common operations, including:

## Topics Covered

- **Lists**  
  - CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Built-in Functions: `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, `index()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`
  - Nested Lists

- **Tuples**  
  - Immutable ordered sequences
  - CRUD operations (create, read, delete)

- **Sets**  
  - Unordered collections with no duplicates
  - Built-in Functions: `add()`, `update()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `symmetric_difference()`

- **Dictionaries**  
  - Key-value storage
  - Built-in Functions: `pop()`, `popitem()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `update()`

## Key Concepts and Tasks

### Task 1 – List Basics
Define a list of 6 items and:
- Print the number of items  
- Print second and second-last elements  
- Slice from the second to third elements  

### Task 2 – List Methods
Use `append()` and `insert()` to modify the list `[1, 2, 3]` into `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`  

### Task 3 – Nested Lists
Work with nested lists:
- Access number `5`  
- Append `10` to the last list  

### Task 4 – Tuple Task
Create a tuple and print its last element  

### Task 5 – Set Task
Create an empty set and add elements `1, 2, 3`, then print  

### Task 6 – Check Element in Set
Check membership of elements in a set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`  

### Task 7 – Set Operations
Create sets `A` and `B`, apply:
- Union  
- Intersection  
- Difference  
- Assign union to `B`  
- Delete all sets  

### Task 8 – Dictionary Task
- Create dictionary `student`  
- Update age  
- Add `phone_number`  
- Delete `course`  

### Task 9 – File 6: Practice on Data Structures & Functions
Practice advanced usage of Python data structures and functions:
- **Strings**:  
  - Count vowels  
  - Capitalize every second letter  
- **Lists**:  
  - Filter even numbers  
  - Remove duplicates  
- **Sets**:  
  - Perform union and intersection using functions  
- **Tuples**:  
  - Sort list of tuples by second item  
  - Reverse a tuple  
- **Dictionaries**:  
  - Extract keys and values into lists  
  - Safely retrieve a value  
- **Functions and Control Flow**:  
  - Use `if`/`else` and loops  
  - Implement functions (e.g., sum of inputs, factorial, etc.)
