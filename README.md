## Chapters Overview

###  Chapter 01 & 02 – Python Basics
- Printing to the console  
- Variables and constants  
- Taking user input  
- Basic data types (integers, floats, strings)  
- Fundamental coding exercises to build confidence with syntax and logic  

---

###  Chapter 03 – Strings, Formatting, and Conditionals
- String formatting: `f-strings`, `.format()`  
- String operations: concatenation, indexing, slicing, repetition, escape characters  
- Built-in functions: `help()`, `dir()`  
- Common string methods: `len()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, etc.  
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`, nested conditions  
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Practical tasks: password validation, number classification, string cleaning

### Chapter 04 – Data Structures
- **Lists**: CRUD operations, methods like `append()`, `pop()`, slicing, nested lists  
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences, element access  
- **Sets**: Unique elements, set operations (union, intersection, difference)  
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value storage, modifying data
- Integration with functions and logic flow:
  - Count vowels in a string  
  - Filter even numbers from lists  
  - Sort list of tuples  

---

###  Chapter 05 – Loops & Functions
- **For loops**: basic and nested iteration, `zip()` function  
- **While loops**: counters, loop control  
- **Break** and **Continue** statements  
- **Functions**:
  - Creating and calling functions  
  - Parameters and arguments (default, keyword, positional)  
  - Return values vs print  
  - Lambda expressions  
  - Nested functions  
  - Scope: global vs local  
- Functional tasks:
  - Check list 
  - Print formatted full names  
  - Classify numbers as even or odd  
  - Use loops for counting and iteration
